		<p>Overwatch 2 is a competitive, First-Person Shooter where I served as an Associate Hero Designer. I worked on many prototypes for playable characters and abilities. I also helped finalize development on many heroes in production through adding custom control settings, stat tracking, achievements, unlock challenges, custom game modifiers, and final bug fixing. I provided broad support to other disciplines, such as Event Design and System Design, both when it related to heroes and also more generally.</p>

		<p>For April Fools in 2023, we released a game mode where every single character had a gameplay change to them. I designed a handful, implemented about 2/3 of them, and wrote many of the joke, patch-note entries. This mode was increadibly well received by players, and significantly increased player win-back and retention. </p>

		<p>I worked on many features for the game, centering around playable heroes, that directly saught to better the overall game experience with an added focus on Console players. I creating new and reworke the existing controller vibrations for over 100 different abilities alongside making custom adjustment settings for players to tune the rumble exactly how they enjoy. I implemented control input settings which improved Accessibility and the general play experience. I implemented settings to customize the UI to help with visibilty.</p>

		<p>I created the hazards in the Starwatch event mode. I provided polish, made bespoke interations on a per character basis, tuned physics, and more.</p>
