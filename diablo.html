		<p>Diablo IV is an Action Role-playing game for PC, Xbox, and Playstation. I worked as a class designer on the project, developing content across a variety of gameplay systems for various different classes. This content ranged from as simple as adding in equipment that modifies skills to reworking an entire class.

		<p>I was the designer assigned to the rework of the Spiritborn class for the Lord of Hatred expansion. I added in significant new options for skills, including developing a at least one major new variant for each skill. This involved plenty of large-scale paper designing, working directly with VFX, UI, Audio Design, and more. </p>

		<p>For the eight season of Diablo, Belial's Return. I led the class developments. I implemented a customizable power system where players could take 24 different powers with Major and Modifier variants and combine them into a unique power. These were powers inspired by the bosses available in Diablo IV, but remixed to work for player characters. Creating this system required working directly with engineers to allow for new functionality to modify power functionality externally and for powers to have multiple use-cases depending on the context.</p>
